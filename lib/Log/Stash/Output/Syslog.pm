=head1 NAME

Log::Stash::Output::Syslog - output logstash messages to Syslog.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    logstash --output STDOUT --output Syslog --output_options '{"port":"5140"}'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a syslogd client.

Can be used to ship syslog logs into a L<Log::Stash> system.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 host

The IP to bind the daemon to. By default, binds to 127.0.0.1, which
means that the server can only be accessed from localhost. Use C<0.0.0.0>
to bind to all interfaces.

=head2 port

The port to bind to, defaults to 5140, as the default syslog port (514)
is likely already taken by your regular syslogd, and needs root permission
to bind to it.

=head2 protocol

The protocol to listen on, can be either C<tcp> or C<udp>, with udp being
the default.
