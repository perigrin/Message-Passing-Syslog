NAME
    Log::Stash::Input::Syslog - input logstash messages from Syslog.

SYNOPSIS
        logstash --output STDOUT --input Syslog --input_options '{"port":"5140"}'

DESCRIPTION
    Provides a syslogd server for either TCP or UDP syslog.

    Can be used to ship syslog logs into a Log::Stash system.

ATTRIBUTES
  host
    The IP to bind the daemon to. By default, binds to 127.0.0.1, which
    means that the server can only be accessed from localhost. Use 0.0.0.0
    to bind to all interfaces.

  port
    The port to bind to, defaults to 5140, as the default syslog port (514)
    is likely already taken by your regular syslogd, and needs root
    permission to bind to it.

  protocol
    The protocol to listen on, can be either "tcp" or "udp", with udp being
    the default.
